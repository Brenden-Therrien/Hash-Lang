##  What is the Setup Wizard?

The Setup Wizard is an **interactive guide** that helps new users get started with Hash Language. It runs after installation and walks you through:

1.  **Verifying Installation** - Checks compiler, examples, docs
2. üìÅ **Creating Workspace** - Sets up a project folder with starter examples
3.  **Configuring VS Code** - Opens your workspace in VS Code
4.  **Quick Tutorial** - 2-minute crash course in Hash basics
5.  **First Program** - Run Hello World and see Hash in action!

##  Running the Wizard

### Automatically (Recommended)

The wizard prompts you to run after installation:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
# ... installation completes ...
# Wizard prompt appears:
# "Would you like to run the interactive setup wizard now? (Y/N)"
```

### Manually

Run the wizard anytime:

```powershell
# From Hash directory
.\setup-wizard.ps1

# Or using hash command
hash --setup
```

## What the Wizard Does

### Step 1: Verify Installation

Checks that everything is properly installed:
-  Hash compiler (hashc.exe)
-  Global 'hash' command
-  Example programs (23 files)

- Documents/HashProjects

But you can create your own:
```powershell
mkdir C:\Dev\MyHashStuff
cd C:\Dev\MyHashStuff
```

### Example Selection

- **Option 1**: Just hello.hash (smallest)
